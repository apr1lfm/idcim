# iphonedcim
Python command-line tool for exporting media and some metadata from the iOS Photos library in Linux.
**A better alternative is [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos) (MacOS/Linux).** This is just a personal project more than anything.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Linux
- [ifuse](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ifuse#ifuse): Mounts the media partition from an iOS device connected via USB (make sure your computer is trusted in iOS).
